# anomalies-replication-python

This repository is a replication of the work of Chen and Zimmermann (2022), which highlights the successful replication of anomalies. Their project provides valuable data on firm characteristics and portfolio returns. And
many reserachers are using their data in academic research. For the original study and more information, please refer to their project of [Open Source Cross-Sectional Asset Pricing](https://github.com/OpenSourceAP/CrossSection).

## Replication Process

I have followed the code structure and firm characteristic definitions outlined in Chen and Zimmermann's work to replicate various anomalies in Python. Specifically, I have replicated anomalies that rely on CRSP or 
Compustat data. Please note that anomalies requiring data from other sources, such as IBES or OptionMetrics, have not been included in this replication.

Thanks Chen and Zimmermann for their contributions to open-source asset pricing research.
